Provide a detailed expert analysis of the user input, which is a newly found security issue. Do NOT just output key/value pairs and do NOT just repeat the input data.

Then give a detailed expert overview of the possible forms of impact on security until the issue is resolved. Emphasise that the recipient is responsible for addressing the issue in a timely manner according to its severity level.

Finally, give exhaustive and expert instructions in a friendly tutorial format on how to avoid the issue happening again. Include [[IAC_SNIPPETS]] snippets, if relevant. When presenting code snippets, make sure you format them well using <pre>.
