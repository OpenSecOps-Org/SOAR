# SOAR Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the OpenSecOps Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) architecture, including detailed workflow analysis, data structures, error handling patterns, and testing strategies.

## System Overview

OpenSecOps SOAR is a serverless AWS-native security automation platform that processes security findings, automates remediation, manages tickets for manual intervention, and generates AI-powered security reports. The system operates across an AWS Organization, providing centralized security management for all accounts.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. State Machine Workflows

The system is built around AWS Step Functions state machines that orchestrate complex security workflows:

#### SOARASFFProcessor (Main Orchestrator)

### 2. Standard Data Structure (Scratchpad)

All functions operate on a standardized data structure established by the ASFF Processor:

```json
{
  "account": {},              // Account metadata from GetAccountDataFunction
  "finding": {},              // Complete ASFF Security Hub finding data
  "tags": {},                 // Resource tags for context
  "actions": {               // Control flags set by processing functions
    "suppress_finding": false,
    "autoremediation_not_done": false,
    "reconsider_later": false
  },
  "messages": {              // Communication templates
    "actions_taken": "None.",
    "actions_required": "...",
    "ai": {
      "plaintext": "",
      "html": ""
    }
  },
  "db": {}                   // DynamoDB lookup results and cached data
}
```

### 3. Error Handling and Retry Patterns

The system implements consistent error handling across all state machines:

#### Standard Retry Configuration
- **Interval**: 3 seconds
- **Backoff Rate**: 3.0 (exponential backoff)
- **Max Attempts**: 10-100 (varies by function criticality)

#### Error Type Handling
- **Lambda.ServiceException**: Standard retry with exponential backoff
- **Lambda.AWSLambdaException**: Extended retry for AWS service issues
- **DynamoDB.ProvisionedThroughputExceededException**: Specialized retry for database throttling
- **States.TaskFailed**: Catch-all for general task failures
- **States.ALL**: Comprehensive catch-all for any unhandled exceptions

#### Fallback-to-Ticketing Error Handling (v2.2.1+)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 30+ autoremediation functions protected by state machine catch-all error handling
- **Centralized Error Handler**: `SetAutoremediationNotDone` state sets `actions.autoremediation_not_done = true` for any unhandled failures
- **Data Preservation**: Pure ASL implementation preserves all original scratchpad data while adding error flag
- **Workflow Integration**: Failed autoremediations automatically route to ticketing system for manual intervention
- **Zero Silent Failures**: Eliminates workflow failures from unhandled Lambda exceptions or API errors

#### AI Function Special Handling
- **Timeout**: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- **Throttling Protection**: Extended retry intervals
- **Memory Allocation**: Higher memory limits for AI processing

## Function Architecture (77 Total Lambda Functions)

3. **Scoring**: Penalty scores calculated based on severity and environment
4. **Decision**: GetTicketAndDecideFunction determines workflow path:
   - **Auto-remediate**: Route to SOARAutoRemediations state machine
   - **Incident Response**: Route to SOARIncidents state machine
   - **Manual Intervention**: Create ticket and notify teams
   - **Suppress**: Apply suppression rules and update finding status
5. **Execution**: Appropriate actions taken based on decision
6. **Tracking**: Results recorded in DynamoDB and Security Hub updated

### 5. Automated Remediation Architecture

The system includes 30 specialized Lambda functions for remediating specific AWS security controls:

#### Service Coverage
- **RDS** (9 controls): Database encryption, snapshot settings, security configurations
- **EC2** (6 controls): Security group configurations, unnecessary ports, instance settings
- **S3** (5 controls): Bucket permissions, encryption settings, public access
- **IAM** (3 controls): Excessive permissions, policy compliance
- **ELB** (2 controls): Load balancer security settings
- **ECR** (2 controls): Container registry security

### 4. Ticketing and Notification System

For issues requiring human intervention:

1. Tickets are created with detailed information
2. Email notifications are sent to appropriate teams
3. Reminder system tracks overdue tickets
4. Resolution process is monitored and recorded

The system uses specialized formatters for different issue types (GuardDuty findings, general compliance issues, etc.).

### 5. Multi-Account Management

SOAR operates across an AWS Organization:

- **Organization Admin Account**: Hosts the SOAR application and centralized security operations
- **Security Account**: Used for managing the security posture and setting security controls
- **Member Accounts**: Where findings are detected and remediated

Cross-account access is managed via IAM roles with least privilege principles.

### 6. AI Integration

AI capabilities enhance the security operations:

- **Weekly Security Reports**: AI-generated analysis of security posture
- **Recommendations**: Contextual security improvement suggestions
- **Incident Analysis**: AI-assisted investigation of security incidents

### 7. Reporting and Analytics

The system maintains historical data for:

- Auto-remediation effectiveness
- Incident trends
- Ticket resolution times
- Account security posture over time

## Technical Architecture

#### Cross-State Machine Error Handling
- **Retry Logic**: Consistent 3-second intervals with exponential backoff
- **Error Propagation**: Structured error responses maintain workflow state
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable

### Deployment Model

- **AWS SAM**: Defines infrastructure as code
- **CloudFormation**: Manages resource provisioning
- **Multi-region**: Supports deployment across regions
- **Versioned Releases**: Tracked via git tags and CHANGELOG

## Security and Compliance Considerations

- **Least Privilege**: Minimal IAM permissions for operations
- **Environment-based Prioritization**: Higher security standards for production
- **Audit Trail**: Records all remediation actions and decisions
- **Cross-account Security**: Controlled access between accounts

## Scalability

- **Serverless Architecture**: Scales with security finding volume
- **Stateless Processing**: Allows horizontal scaling
- **Account Parallelism**: Processes multiple accounts concurrently

## Operational Model

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined in template.yaml
- **Automated Deployment**: Via deploy script
- **CI/CD Ready**: Structured for pipeline integration
- **Configuration Management**: Via parameters and environment variables

## Event-Driven Architecture Pattern

SOAR follows established event-driven patterns for state transitions, with two primary approaches based on AWS API constraints:

### Update-and-Reprocess Workflow (Mutable Fields)
1. **State Change**: Lambda function calls Security Hub `batch_update_findings` API
2. **Event Generation**: Security Hub automatically generates new finding event with updated status
3. **Fresh Processing**: SOAR processes the new event with corrected data from the beginning
4. **Clean Logic**: All workflow decisions use the updated finding state

**Use Cases**:
- **Auto-Remediation Completion**: Sets `Workflow.Status: 'RESOLVED'` â†’ Triggers ticket closure workflow
- **Finding Suppression**: Sets `Workflow.Status: 'SUPPRESSED'` â†’ Triggers cleanup actions
- **Severity Reclassification**: Updates `Severity.Label` â†’ Triggers reprocessing with correct severity

### Create-and-Suppress Workflow (Immutable Fields)
1. **Create New Finding**: Lambda function calls Security Hub `batch_import_findings` API with corrected data
2. **Suppress Original**: Lambda function calls Security Hub `batch_update_findings` API to suppress original finding
3. **Terminate Current**: Sets `terminate_for_reprocessing` flag to end current workflow
4. **Fresh Processing**: New finding triggers fresh SOAR processing with corrected data

**Use Cases**:
- **Account Routing Correction**: Creates finding in correct account when `AwsAccountId` is immutable
- **Cross-Account Finding Creation**: Routes findings to appropriate account teams

### Account Reassignment Preprocessor

AWS Security Hub delegated administration architecture creates account routing mismatches for certain security services (IAM Access Analyzer, GuardDuty, Inspector, Detective). These services generate findings that appear to originate from the Security-Adm account but actually concern resources in member accounts.

**Problem**: Finding shows `AwsAccountId: 111111111111` (Security-Adm) but resource is in account `222222222222`

**Solution**: Account Reassignment Preprocessor detects mismatches and creates corrected findings in the appropriate accounts:

1. **Detection**: Two-tier approach comparing `AwsAccountId` with:
   - **Priority 1**: `ProductFields.ResourceOwnerAccount` field
   - **Priority 2**: Account extracted from resource ARN (arn:aws:service:region:account:resource)
2. **Recreation**: Uses `batch_import_findings` to create properly structured ASFF finding in target account
3. **Suppression**: Sets `actions.suppress_finding = True` to trigger state machine suppression of original finding
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Any failure preserves original workflow (fail-safe design)
5. **Fresh Processing**: New finding triggers complete SOAR processing in correct account

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Production-Ready**: All 25 tests passing with comprehensive TDD coverage
- **ASFF Compliance**: Follows AWS Security Hub BatchImportFindings API requirements exactly
- **Zero AWS Costs**: Comprehensive mocking prevents real API calls during testing
- **Cross-Account Support**: Uses established SOAR `get_client` patterns for secure access
- **Unique ID Generation**: Creates unique finding IDs using `{original-id}-reassigned-{account-id}` pattern

**Integration**: Account Reassignment Preprocessor integrates into the ASFF processor state machine after AWS Health Reclassifier, with Choice node routing to existing suppression functionality when `actions.suppress_finding = true`.

### Benefits
- **Consistent Processing**: All workflows use the same updated finding data
- **Audit Trail**: Security Hub maintains complete state change history
- **Downstream Integration**: Other Security Hub consumers see corrected data
- **Loop Prevention**: Updates are unidirectional (e.g., HIGH â†’ INFORMATIONAL only)
- **Correct Team Notification**: Findings reach the teams responsible for the actual resources

This pattern enables the SOAR to maintain clean separation between decision logic and state management while ensuring all systems have consistent, up-to-date finding information and appropriate team routing.

## CloudWatch Alarm Integration and Monitoring

### System Self-Monitoring Architecture

The OpenSecOps platform implements comprehensive self-monitoring through CloudWatch alarms that automatically create SOAR incidents for operational failures. This ensures that infrastructure issues are handled through the same security incident response workflow as other security findings.

#### Alarm Processing Workflow

1. **Alarm Creation**: CloudWatch alarms monitor AWS services (Step Functions, Lambda, etc.)
2. **Event Generation**: Alarm state changes to "ALARM" trigger EventBridge events
3. **Event Processing**: SOAR-all-alarms-to-sec-hub component converts alarm events to Security Hub findings
4. **SOAR Processing**: Main SOAR system processes alarm findings as incidents
5. **Incident Response**: Alarms are routed through standard incident workflows with AI analysis

#### SOAR-all-alarms-to-sec-hub Component

**Purpose**: Converts CloudWatch alarm state change events into AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF) findings in Security Hub

**Trigger Pattern**: EventBridge rule matching CloudWatch alarms transitioning to "ALARM" state:
```yaml
Pattern:
  source: [aws.cloudwatch]
  detail-type: [CloudWatch Alarm State Change]
  detail:
    state:
      value: [ALARM]
```

**Processing Logic**:
- Extracts alarm metadata (name, description, account, region, timestamp)
- Suppresses CIS-related alarms to avoid operational noise
- Requires severity level in alarm name (INFORMATIONAL|LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL)  
- Determines incident domain: "INFRA" (infrastructure) vs "APP" (application) based on alarm name
- Creates ASFF-compliant Security Hub finding

**ASFF Structure Created**:
```json
{
  "SchemaVersion": "2018-10-08",
  "Types": ["Software and Configuration Checks/CloudWatch Alarms/soar-cloudwatch-alarms"],
  "Title": "ALARM_NAME",
  "Description": "ALARM_DESCRIPTION or N/A",
  "Severity": {"Label": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW|etc"},
  "Resources": [{"Type": "AwsAccountId", "Id": "account_id", "Region": "region"}],
  "ProductFields": {
    "IncidentDomain": "INFRA|APP",
    "TicketDestination": "TEAM"
  }
}
```

#### Alarm Naming Convention

All monitoring alarms follow the pattern: `[DOMAIN]-[Component]-[Type]-[Severity]`

**Domain Types**:
- **INFRA**: Infrastructure alarms routed to infrastructure/operations teams
- **APP**: Application alarms that can be routed to application development teams

**Examples**:
- `INFRA-SOAR-ASFF-Processor-SM-Failure-HIGH`
- `INFRA-CombineLogFilesSM-Failure-HIGH`
- `INFRA-SOAR-Weekly-AI-Report-SM-Failure-MEDIUM`
- `APP-UserService-Lambda-Error-MEDIUM` (hypothetical application alarm)

This naming convention enables:
- Automatic severity extraction and incident routing
- Incident domain classification (INFRA vs APP) for appropriate team assignment
- Complete incident management coverage across infrastructure and application layers
- Consistent AI prompt context and analysis

#### SOAR Platform Self-Monitoring

**Core State Machine Monitoring** (HIGH severity):
- SOAR ASFF Processor failures
- Auto-Remediation state machine failures  
- Incident processing failures

**Operational Monitoring** (MEDIUM/LOW severity):
- Weekly AI Report generation failures
- Hourly maintenance task failures
- Control synchronization failures

**Alarm Configuration**:
- **Metric**: `ExecutionsFailed` from `AWS/States` namespace
- **Threshold**: >= 1 failed execution
- **Period**: 60 seconds with 1 evaluation period
- **Treatment**: Missing data treated as not breaching

#### Foundation Platform Self-Monitoring

**Log Processing Infrastructure** (HIGH severity):
- Control Tower log aggregation failures
- Historical log processing failures

**Alarm Configuration**: Same pattern as SOAR alarms, monitoring Step Functions execution failures

#### AI-Enhanced Incident Analysis

Recent enhancements (v2.2.1) provide comprehensive AI-powered incident analysis capabilities:

**Intelligence Features**:
- **Component-Specific Analysis**: Deep understanding of each state machine and Lambda function's purpose
- **Context-Aware Prompts**: AI prompts distinguish between individual failures vs. systemic issues
- **Impact Assessment**: Explains operational impact and urgency levels based on component criticality
- **Targeted Recommendations**: Provides specific troubleshooting steps tailored to each alarm type
- **Operational Continuity**: Emphasizes that single failures don't indicate complete system breakdown

**Enhanced Diagnostic Capabilities**:
- **Failure Context**: AI understands the role and dependencies of each failing component
- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Component-specific debugging procedures and common resolution steps
- **Automated Infrastructure Knowledge**: Self-updating understanding of system architecture
- **Multi-Account Awareness**: Context-aware analysis across different AWS accounts and environments

**Analysis Inputs**:
The AI analysis receives the alarm-based ASFF finding and provides contextualized guidance based on:
- Component type (SOAR core vs. operational vs. Foundation vs. application)
- Severity level and expected operational impact
- Component criticality and dependencies
- Historical patterns and troubleshooting procedures
- Account context and organizational structure

#### Limitations and Context Gaps

**Current Context Available**:
- Alarm name, description, and basic metadata
- Account and region information
- Severity level and incident domain classification
- Timestamp of alarm trigger

**Missing Context for Enhanced Debugging**:
- Specific Step Functions execution ARN and failure details
- CloudWatch Logs from failed Lambda functions
- Actual metric values that triggered the alarm
- Execution timeline and specific failure points
- Resource-specific details beyond account-level information

This comprehensive alarm integration ensures that both SOAR and Foundation infrastructure failures are automatically detected, classified, and routed through the standard security incident response workflow with appropriate AI-powered analysis and operational guidance.

## CloudWatch Alarm Context Enrichment Enhancement

### Proposed Architecture Enhancement

To address the context limitations identified above, a **CloudWatch Context Enrichment Function** is proposed to provide AI-powered incident analysis with comprehensive debugging information and historical pattern analysis.

#### Enhanced Context Enrichment Function

**Purpose**: Enrich CloudWatch alarm-based incidents with detailed execution context, logs, and historical pattern analysis before AI processing.

**Integration Point**: Added to SOARIncidents state machine between instruction retrieval and AI analysis for both APP and INFRA domains.

**State Machine Placement**:
```yaml
# After "Format Generic message" and before "Email to Whom?"
EnrichCloudWatchContext:
  Type: Task
  Resource: '${EnrichCloudWatchContextFunctionArn}'
  TimeoutSeconds: 300
  Condition: Finding type contains "CloudWatch Alarms"
  Next: Email to Whom?
```

#### Intelligent Enrichment Logic

**Service-Aware Processing**:
- **Step Functions Failures**: Extract execution ARNs, failure details, execution history
- **Lambda Function Errors**: Retrieve CloudWatch Logs, error messages, invocation details  
- **Generic AWS Services**: Basic metric and configuration data

**Temporal Correlation**:
- Calculate exact alarm evaluation window using Period Ã— EvaluationPeriods
- Query failed executions/invocations within specific time window that triggered alarm
- Eliminates false correlation with unrelated failures

**Memory and Pattern Analysis**:
- Query DynamoDB incidents table using configurable retention period (`IncidentExpirationInDays`)
- Analyze incident frequency across multiple time windows (7d, 30d, 90d, full retention)
- Detect pattern trends: INCREASING, DECREASING, STABLE
- Classify incidents: RARE_OCCURRENCE, FREQUENT_RECENT, RECURRING_PATTERN, ISOLATED_INCIDENT, BASELINE_DEGRADATION
- Determine success baselines from recent execution history

#### Enhanced Context Data Structure

**Technical Enrichment**:
```json
{
  "service_type": "stepfunctions|lambda|generic",
  "alarm_correlation": {
    "evaluation_window": {...},
    "total_executions_in_window": N
  },
  "failed_executions": [
    {
      "execution_arn": "...",
      "failure_details": {...},
      "logs_summary": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pattern Analysis**:
```json
{
  "pattern_analysis": {
    "retention_period_days": 365,
    "incident_trends": {
      "recent_rate": 0.5,
      "trend_direction": "INCREASING|STABLE|DECREASING"
    },
    "pattern_classification": "FREQUENT_RECENT|ISOLATED_INCIDENT|...",
    "baseline_context": {
      "success_rate": 0.95,
      "last_successful_execution": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

#### AI Enhancement Benefits

The enriched context enables AI analysis to provide:

1. **Precise Debugging**: "Step XYZ failed with error ABC in execution DEF, check log stream GHI for root cause JKL"
2. **Pattern Awareness**: "This is the 3rd occurrence in 7 days, suggesting systematic issue vs. isolated failure"
3. **Baseline Comparison**: "Success rate dropped from 95% to 60% vs. isolated failure in otherwise healthy system"
4. **Historical Context**: "Last successful execution 2 hours ago vs. no successful executions in 48 hours"
5. **Trend Analysis**: "Increasing failure frequency suggests underlying degradation vs. random operational issue"

#### Error Resilience and Performance

- **Graceful Degradation**: Enrichment failures don't block incident processing
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Only processes CloudWatch alarm findings with enrichable patterns
- **Configurable Timeouts**: 300-second limit prevents workflow delays
- **Cost Optimization**: Respects configured retention periods and query limits
- **Cross-Account Integration**: Leverages existing SOAR IAM roles for API access

This enhancement transforms AI incident analysis from reactive debugging to **pattern-aware, context-rich incident intelligence**, significantly improving operational response quality and debugging efficiency.
