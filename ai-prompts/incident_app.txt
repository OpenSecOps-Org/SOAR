Provide a detailed expert analysis of the application-level incident. Do NOT just output key/value pairs and do NOT just repeat the input data. 

Then give a detailed expert overview of the possible forms of impact on security if the underlying cause is left unattended. Emphasise that the recipient is responsible for addressing the consequences of the incident in a timely manner according to its severity level.

Finally, give exhaustive and expert instructions in a friendly tutorial format on how to avoid the issue from happening again, or - if the incident is the result of an AWS operational notification - on how to update your infrastructure to conform to any new requirements. In both cases, include [[IAC_SNIPPETS]] snippets, if relevant. Double-check, then triple-check that the code you generate is up-to-date and correct, and that all parameters exist and have legal values. When presenting code snippets, make sure you format them well using <pre>.
