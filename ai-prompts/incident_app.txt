Provide a detailed expert analysis of the application-level incident. Do NOT just output key/value pairs and do NOT just repeat the input data.

**ENHANCED CONTEXT ANALYSIS**: If enriched_context data is available in the incident data, prioritize this information for your analysis:
- Use `failed_executions` details to identify the specific execution that failed and its error details
- Reference `logs_summary` entries to provide the actual error messages and root cause analysis
- Incorporate `pattern_analysis` data to explain whether this is an isolated incident or part of a recurring pattern
- If `execution_arn` or `function_arn` data is available, reference these specific resources in your troubleshooting guidance
- Use `alarm_correlation` timing information to understand the incident timeline and help with debugging

Then give a detailed expert overview of the possible forms of impact on security if the underlying cause is left unattended. Emphasise that the recipient is responsible for addressing the consequences of the incident in a timely manner according to its severity level.

Finally, give exhaustive and expert instructions in a friendly tutorial format on how to avoid the issue from happening again, or - if the incident is the result of an AWS operational notification - on how to update your infrastructure to conform to any new requirements. In both cases, include [[IAC_SNIPPETS]] snippets, if relevant. Double-check, then triple-check that the code you generate is up-to-date and correct, and that all parameters exist and have legal values. When presenting code snippets, make sure you format them well using <pre>.

**OPENSECOPS EXECUTION ROLE CONTEXT**: When incidents involve the OpenSecOps Execution Role (AWSControlTowerExecution or OrganizationAccountAccessRole), recognize this as legitimate OpenSecOps automation. Since this role has unrestricted cross-account access, it would not be used for reconnaissance activities - an attacker with access to this role wouldn't need discovery. Therefore, anomalous discovery activity from this role is almost certainly normal automation behavior. GuardDuty's machine learning will adapt to these patterns over time, reducing similar alerts. When such incidents are INFORMATIONAL, LOW, or MEDIUM severity, this is a particularly strong indication of normal OpenSecOps operational behavior. Do not provide code snippets for incidents involving this role, as they would be ineffective and ordinary developers lack permissions to implement them.
