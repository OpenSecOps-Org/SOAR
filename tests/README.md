# OpenSecOps SOAR Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the OpenSecOps SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform.

## Overview

The SOAR platform implements automated security response and remediation across AWS environments. Given its critical role in security operations and its privileged access across all AWS accounts, comprehensive testing is essential to ensure reliability and prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Strategic Importance

**Current Risk Assessment**: SOAR represents the highest security risk component in the OpenSecOps platform due to:
- Full privileged access across all AWS accounts
- Automated security remediation capabilities
- Complex cross-service AWS integrations
- Direct incident response automation

**Testing Priority**: As the most complex product with full access rights everywhere, SOAR testing patterns will serve as the template for expanding testing across all other OpenSecOps repositories.

## Test Infrastructure Strategy

### Chosen Approach: Pure Mocking (pytest + moto)

**Decision Rationale**:
- ✅ **Proven Success**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure with 428 unit tests
- ✅ **Lightweight**: Fast execution (typically <0.1 seconds per test)
- ✅ **Zero AWS Costs**: No real AWS resources needed
- ✅ **Easy Contributor Setup**: Simple `pip install` requirements
- ✅ **Offline Development**: Works without internet/AWS credentials
- ✅ **Deterministic**: Consistent results, no flaky tests

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Container-Based (LocalStack)**: More realistic but heavier setup, Docker dependency
**Real AWS Sandbox**: 100% realistic but costly and complex credential management
**Hybrid Approach**: Future consideration for complex integration scenarios

## Current Testing Infrastructure

### Testing Framework
- **Framework**: pytest
- **AWS Mocking**: moto library for AWS service simulation
- **Coverage**: pytest-cov for code coverage analysis
- **Structure**: Centralized test data management via `tests/fixtures/asff_data.py`

## Testing Standards and Patterns

### Documentation-First Testing Methodology

**All test implementation must begin with comprehensive documentation of source files.** This critical first step ensures efficient and effective test development:

#### 1. Complete Function Analysis
Before writing any tests, thoroughly analyze and document:
- **Function structure and entry points**
- **Internal helper functions and their purposes**
- **Remediation logic and step-by-step workflows**
- **Error handling patterns and exception paths**
- **Input validation and ASFF parsing logic**
- **Cross-account access patterns**
- **AWS API calls and resource modifications**

#### 2. Strategic Implementation Planning
Documentation enables:
- **Optimal test ordering** based on complexity and learning opportunities
- **Pattern recognition** across similar functions for code reuse
- **Comprehensive test coverage** by understanding all execution paths
- **Efficient development** by identifying shared test utilities and fixtures

#### 3. Learning-Based Approach
Careful documentation allows LLMs to:
- **Identify similarities** between functions for pattern replication
- **Recognize differences** that require unique test approaches
- **Build incrementally** on previous testing knowledge
- **Optimize test implementation** order for maximum learning efficiency

#### Example Documentation Process
For each function, create comprehensive documentation covering:
```python
"""
Function: auto_remediate_ec2X/app.py
Purpose: [Brief description of security control and remediation]

Structure Analysis:
- lambda_handler(): Main entry point
- helper_function_1(): [Purpose and logic]
- helper_function_2(): [Purpose and logic]

Remediation Steps:
1. Extract resource details from ASFF finding
2. Validate resource existence and state
3. Apply security remediation (detailed steps)
4. Handle errors and edge cases
5. Return results with appropriate messages

Error Handling:
- Resource not found: [Suppression logic]
- Permission denied: [Error propagation]
- API failures: [Retry/fallback logic]

Test Requirements:
- Success scenarios: [List specific cases]
- Error scenarios: [List specific failures]
- Edge cases: [List boundary conditions]
"""
```

### ASFF Standardization
The auto-remediation tests have established comprehensive ASFF (AWS Security Finding Format) standardization patterns:

1. **Centralized Test Data**: All ASFF test cases managed in `fixtures/asff_data.py`
2. **Comprehensive Case Coverage**: Multiple scenarios per control (standalone instances, cluster members, etc.)
3. **Error Handling**: Robust testing of API failures, missing resources, and edge cases
4. **Resource Variation**: Testing across different AWS resource types and configurations

### Mocking Patterns
- **AWS Service Mocking**: Comprehensive moto-based mocking for all AWS services
- **Cross-Account Testing**: Proper role assumption and cross-account access simulation
- **Error Simulation**: Testing of AWS API failures and edge cases
- **Resource State Management**: Proper setup and teardown of mock AWS resources

### Security Testing Requirements
For security-critical functions, tests must include:
- **Permission Validation**: Verify proper IAM role assumptions
- **Cross-Account Access**: Test multi-account scenarios
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Test all failure modes
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and unusual scenarios

## Quick Start

### Automatic Environment Loading (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Copy and configure environment
cp .env.test.example .env.test
nano .env.test  # Edit if needed (defaults work for unit tests)

# 2. Install dependencies including python-dotenv
pip install pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov "moto[all]" boto3 python-dotenv

# 3. Run tests (environment automatically loaded)
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/unit/auto_remediations/rds/
```

### Manual Environment Loading (Alternative)
```bash
# 1. Copy and configure environment
cp .env.test.example .env.test
nano .env.test  # Edit if needed (defaults work for unit tests)

# 2. Install dependencies (without python-dotenv)
pip install pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov "moto[all]" boto3

# 3. Load environment and run tests
source .env.test
pytest tests/unit/
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.12+ and the following tools installed:

```bash
# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.12+

# Install pip if not available
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

### 1. Install Test Dependencies

From the SOAR root directory:

```bash
# Install test packages (including python-dotenv for automatic environment loading)
pip install pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov "moto[all]" boto3 python-dotenv

# Note: LocalStack is not needed as a Python package when using Docker
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy and configure the test environment file:

```bash
# Copy example environment file (from SOAR root directory)
cp .env.test.example .env.test

# Edit .env.test to customize for your environment (optional)
nano .env.test
```

**Environment Loading:**

The testing framework automatically loads `.env.test` via `conftest.py` when python-dotenv is installed.

```bash
# Verify environment variables are loaded
echo $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
echo $LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT
```

### Alternative Environment Loading Methods

The default automatic loading via `conftest.py` works for most cases. Here are alternatives if needed:

#### Manual Loading
```bash
# Load environment before running tests
source .env.test
pytest tests/unit/
```

#### pytest-env Plugin
```bash
# Install pytest-env plugin
pip install pytest-env

# Create pytest.ini with:
# [tool:pytest]
# env_files = .env.test
```

#### Environment Variables Explained

The `.env.test.example` file includes the following configuration categories:

**AWS Testing Configuration:**
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: Primary region for AWS service testing
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Credentials for moto mocking (use "test" values)
- `TEST_ACCOUNT_ID`: Mock account ID for cross-account testing scenarios

**LocalStack Integration:**
- `LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT`: LocalStack service endpoint (default: http://localhost:4566)
- `SERVICES`: AWS services to enable in LocalStack for integration tests

**Test Execution Control:**
- `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS`: Enable/disable LocalStack integration tests
- `RUN_REAL_AWS_TESTS`: Enable/disable real AWS service tests (requires valid credentials)
- `SKIP_SLOW_TESTS`: Skip time-intensive tests during development

**Service-Specific Configuration:**
- Security Hub, DynamoDB, Email, and AI service test parameters
- Ticketing system credentials (Jira, ServiceNow) for integration testing

**Note:** Real AWS testing requires valid credentials and should only be used in dedicated test accounts.

## Running Tests

**Environment Loading:** Tests now automatically load `.env.test` via `conftest.py` using python-dotenv.

**If you don't have python-dotenv installed:**
```bash
# Install python-dotenv for automatic loading
pip install python-dotenv

# OR manually load environment before each test session
source .env.test
```

### Unit Tests (Fast - Default)

```bash
# Run all unit tests (environment automatically loaded)
pytest tests/unit/

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/auto_remediations/rds/    # RDS auto-remediation tests
pytest tests/unit/accounts/                 # Account management tests
pytest tests/unit/findings/                 # Finding processing tests

# Run with coverage reporting
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=functions --cov-report=html

# Run tests in parallel (faster execution)
pytest tests/unit/ -n auto
```

### Integration Tests with LocalStack

#### Option A: Docker Commands (Recommended)

```bash
# Start LocalStack with Docker
docker run --rm -d --name localstack-test \
  -p 4566:4566 \
  -e SERVICES=s3,lambda,dynamodb,iam,sts \
  localstack/localstack

# Verify LocalStack is running
curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health

# Run integration tests (environment automatically loaded)
pytest tests/integration/

# Run specific integration test categories
pytest tests/integration/accounts/         # Account service integration
pytest tests/integration/workflows/        # End-to-end workflows

# Stop LocalStack when done
docker stop localstack-test
```

#### Option B: LocalStack CLI (if Docker unavailable)

```bash
# Start LocalStack CLI (may have dependency issues)
localstack start

# Run integration tests (environment automatically loaded)
pytest tests/integration/

# Stop LocalStack
localstack stop
```

### Real AWS Tests (Selective)

**Important:** Real AWS tests require valid AWS credentials in `.env.test` and a dedicated test account.

```bash
# Run only real AWS tests (environment automatically loaded)
pytest tests/integration/ -m "real_aws"

# Run specific real AWS integration
pytest tests/integration/reports/test_bedrock_real.py -m "real_aws"

# Skip real AWS tests (default for CI/CD)
pytest tests/integration/ -m "not real_aws"
```

### Test Selection and Filtering

```bash
# Run tests by pattern (environment automatically loaded)
pytest -k "test_rds"                      # All RDS-related tests
pytest -k "test_remediation"              # All remediation tests
pytest -k "test_account and not real_aws" # Account tests excluding real AWS

# Run failed tests only
pytest --lf                               # Last failed
pytest --ff                               # Failed first

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/unit/auto_remediations/rds/

# Generate detailed test report
pytest tests/unit/ --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

```

## Contributor Experience

### Simple Setup for New Contributors
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd SOAR

# Install test dependencies  
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=functions/

# Run specific service tests
pytest tests/unit/auto_remediations/rds/  # RDS only
```

**No Docker required, no AWS credentials needed for unit tests.**

### Development Workflow
1. **Write tests first** for new auto-remediation functions
2. **Use existing patterns** from RDS tests as template
3. **Add test data** to centralized `fixtures/asff_data.py`
4. **Run tests locally** before committing
5. **Verify coverage** meets minimum thresholds

## Test Data Management

The testing strategy utilizes centralized test data management through `fixtures/asff_data.py`. This approach provides:

1. **Consistency**: Standardized ASFF structures across all tests
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for test data
3. **Reusability**: Common test scenarios can be shared across multiple test files
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new test scenarios as coverage expands

## Key Testing Principles

### Security-First Testing
Given SOAR's critical security role, all tests must validate:
- Proper permission handling and role assumptions
- Input sanitization and validation
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Cross-account access controls
- Resource isolation and cleanup

### Comprehensive Edge Case Coverage
Tests should cover:
- Missing or malformed AWS resources
- API failures and timeouts
- Permission denied scenarios
- Resource limits and quotas
- Concurrent access patterns

### Performance Considerations
While security is paramount, tests should also validate:
- Response times for critical operations
- Resource utilization patterns
- Scalability under load
- Memory and CPU usage

## Contribution Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
When adding tests for new auto-remediation functions:

1. **MANDATORY: Documentation-First Analysis**: Before writing any tests, thoroughly analyze and document the source function:
   - Complete function structure analysis
   - Document all internal helper functions
   - Map out remediation logic step-by-step
   - Identify error handling patterns
   - Note AWS API calls and cross-account patterns
   - Plan test coverage based on this analysis

2. **Follow ASFF Patterns**: Use established patterns from RDS and EC2 tests
3. **Centralize Test Data**: Add new test scenarios to `fixtures/asff_data.py`
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include positive, negative, and edge cases
5. **Mock AWS Services**: Use moto for all AWS API interactions
6. **Document Test Cases**: Clear descriptions of what each test validates

### Test File Naming Convention
```
test_{service}_{control_number}.py
# Examples:
test_rds_1.py    # RDS.1 control
test_ec2_15.py   # EC2.15 control
test_s3_8.py     # S3.8 control
```

### Required Test Coverage
New auto-remediation functions must include:
- ✅ Successful remediation scenarios
- ✅ Resource not found handling
- ✅ Permission denied scenarios
- ✅ API failure simulation
- ✅ Invalid input handling
- ✅ Cross-account access testing

## Test Development Guidelines

### Writing Unit Tests

Follow the established ASFF standardization pattern:

```python
import pytest
from moto import mock_rds, mock_sts
from tests.fixtures.asff_data import create_asff_event

@mock_rds
@mock_sts  
def test_rds_remediation_example():
    # Use standardized ASFF test data
    event = create_asff_event(
        service="RDS",
        control_id="RDS.9",
        resource_id="db-instance-123"
    )
    
    # Setup AWS service mocks
    rds_client = boto3.client('rds', region_name='us-east-1')
    
    # Create test resources
    rds_client.create_db_instance(
        DBInstanceIdentifier='test-db',
        DBInstanceClass='db.t3.micro',
        Engine='postgres'
    )
    
    # Test the function
    from functions.auto_remediations.auto_remediate_rds9.app import lambda_handler
    result = lambda_handler(event, None)
    
    # Assert expected behavior
    assert result['actions']['autoremediation_not_done'] is False
    assert 'enabled CloudWatch logging' in result['messages']['actions_taken']
```

### Writing Integration Tests

Use LocalStack for realistic AWS service interactions:

```python
import pytest
from localstack_client import config as localstack_config

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_asff_processor_workflow():
    # Use LocalStack endpoint
    with localstack_config.LocalStackConfig() as config:
        # Test complete workflow
        security_hub = boto3.client('securityhub', endpoint_url=config.endpoint_url)
        
        # Create finding
        finding = security_hub.batch_import_findings(Findings=[...])
        
        # Trigger workflow
        # Assert end-to-end results
```

### ASFF Data Standardization

All tests should use the centralized ASFF helper:

```python
from tests.fixtures.asff_data import create_asff_event

# Create standardized test data
event = create_asff_event(
    service="EC2",
    control_id="EC2.15", 
    resource_id="i-1234567890abcdef0",
    account_id="123456789012"
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### LocalStack Connection Issues
```bash
# Check LocalStack status
localstack status

# Restart LocalStack
localstack stop && localstack start

# Check LocalStack logs
localstack logs
```

#### Moto AWS Service Issues
```bash
# Clear moto cache
rm -rf ~/.moto/

# Update moto to latest version
pip install --upgrade moto[all]
```

#### Test Environment Issues
```bash
# Check if environment variables are loaded
echo $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
echo $LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT

# If empty, re-source the environment
source .env.test

# Reset test environment if needed
unset AWS_ENDPOINT_URL AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

# Verify Python path
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"

# Check installed packages
pip list | grep -E "(pytest|moto|boto3|localstack)"

# Verify .env.test exists and is readable
ls -la .env.test
cat .env.test | head -5
```

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Run tests in parallel (environment automatically loaded)
pytest tests/unit/ -n auto --dist=loadscope

# Skip slow tests during development
pytest tests/unit/ -m "not slow"

# Use pytest cache for faster reruns
pytest tests/unit/ --cache-clear  # Clear cache if needed
```

## Pattern Expansion to Other Repositories

### Template for Other OpenSecOps Components
The SOAR testing patterns will serve as the foundation for testing all other OpenSecOps repositories:

**Foundation Components**:
- Apply moto-based mocking for IAM and policy testing
- Use centralized fixture management
- Implement security-first testing principles

**AFT Components**:
- Test DNS and account provisioning automation
- Validate cross-account access patterns
- Ensure terraform integration testing

**Deployment Strategy**: Export testing templates and infrastructure to all other repositories using the established refresh script mechanism.

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing (Months 4-6)
- **Integration Testing**: LocalStack for complex multi-service scenarios

## Critical Testing Lessons Learned

### ⏺ Critical Testing Lesson Learned 🚨

**The Problem**: When multiple test files import generic module names like `from app import lambda_handler`, pytest can get confused about which module to use when tests run in the same session, leading to tests calling the wrong functions.

**What Happened**:
- My EC2.6 tests: `from functions.auto_remediations.auto_remediate_ec26.app import lambda_handler`
- RDS.4 tests: `from app import lambda_handler`
- When run together, RDS tests were calling the EC2 lambda handler instead of the RDS handler
- This caused RDS tests to fail with EC2-specific errors (trying to parse RDS ARNs as VPC ARNs)

**The Solution**:
1. Use explicit, unique import paths for all lambda handler imports
2. Update @patch decorators to target the specific module paths
3. Example:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Generic import prone to conflicts
from app import lambda_handler
@patch('app.get_client')

# ✅ CORRECT - Explicit path prevents conflicts  
from functions.auto_remediations.auto_remediate_rds4.app import lambda_handler
@patch('functions.auto_remediations.auto_remediate_rds4.app.get_client')
```

**Key Insight**: Test isolation in pytest requires careful attention to module import paths, especially when testing similar functions across different modules. Always use explicit, unique import paths to prevent cross-contamination between test suites.

**Applied Fix**: Updated all RDS.4 tests to use explicit import paths, ensuring proper test isolation while maintaining all functionality. All 127 tests now pass successfully.

### ⚠️ Environment Variable Testing with Module-Level Variables

**The Problem**: Functions that load environment variables at module level (e.g., `TAG = os.environ['TAG']`) cannot be properly tested with `@patch.dict(os.environ, {...})` because the module-level assignment happens at import time, before the test decorator takes effect.

**What Happened in S3.2/S3.3**:
- Functions have `TAG = os.environ['TAG']` at module level
- Test tried to use `@patch.dict(os.environ, {'TAG': 'custom-value'})`
- The patch only affects the test method, but TAG was already loaded during import
- Result: Test fails because the original TAG value is used, not the patched value

**The Solution**:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Environment variable patching (doesn't work for module-level variables)
@patch.dict(os.environ, {'TAG': 'custom-exemption-tag'})
def test_custom_tag_environment(self):
    result = lambda_handler(data, None)

# ✅ CORRECT - Direct module variable patching
@patch('functions.auto_remediations.auto_remediate_s32.app.TAG', 'custom-exemption-tag')
def test_custom_tag_environment(self):
    result = lambda_handler(data, None)
```

**Key Insight**: Always patch the final module-level variable directly rather than the environment variable when the variable is loaded at import time. This ensures the test uses the intended value.

**Applied to**: S3.2 and S3.3 auto-remediation functions that use TAG environment variable for exemption logic.

### 🔍 Testing Functions with Missing Error Handling

**S3.3 Critical Gap Documentation**: When testing functions with known missing error handling (like S3.3), tests should:

1. **Document the gap clearly** in test class docstrings and test names
2. **Test the actual behavior** (unhandled exceptions) rather than ideal behavior
3. **Use descriptive test names** like `test_s33_no_such_bucket_unhandled_exception`
4. **Group gap tests separately** in dedicated test classes like `TestS33CriticalErrorHandlingGaps`
5. **Validate specific exception types** to prevent false positives if behavior changes

**Example Pattern**:
```python
class TestS33CriticalErrorHandlingGaps:
    """Test the critical error handling gaps in S3.3 function
    
    IMPORTANT: These tests document expected failures due to missing error handling.
    Unlike S3.2, this function does not catch AWS API errors gracefully.
    """

    def test_s33_no_such_bucket_unhandled_exception(self):
        """Test that NoSuchBucket error causes unhandled exception (CRITICAL GAP)"""
        # Should raise unhandled exception due to missing error handling
        with pytest.raises(botocore.exceptions.ClientError) as exc_info:
            lambda_handler(asff_data, None)
        assert exc_info.value.response['Error']['Code'] == 'NoSuchBucket'
```

This approach ensures that if error handling is added later, the tests will fail and need updating, preventing silent behavior changes.


### ⚠️ Bug Handling Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: If bugs are discovered in the Lambda function code during testing development, the LLM must:

1. **Stop immediately** and report the bug to the project maintainer
2. **Not attempt to fix** the bug without explicit permission
3. **Not write tests** that validate or test for erroneous behavior
4. **Document the bug** clearly including the specific function, line numbers, and expected vs. actual behavior
5. **Wait for guidance** on how to proceed before continuing with test development

This protocol ensures that:
- Production code changes are properly reviewed and approved
- Bug fixes don't introduce new security vulnerabilities
- Test development doesn't mask or work around underlying issues
- All code changes follow the established review and deployment process

## Strategic Testing Roadmap

4. **Scratchpad Data Structure**: Test the standardized data structure that flows between all functions

**Immediate Next Steps**:
- Begin testing **get_ticket_and_decide** - the central decision maker
- Establish testing patterns for workflow functions
- Validate state machine integration points

### Phase 3: System Integration (PLANNED 🔮)

**Future Testing Scope**:
- End-to-end workflow validation
- State machine integration testing
- Performance and scalability testing
- Cross-function dependency validation
- Real AWS integration testing (selective)

**Strategic Impact**:
The comprehensive testing infrastructure for SOAR establishes the foundation for testing all other OpenSecOps repositories. These proven patterns, infrastructure, and methodologies can be exported to Foundation and AFT components, creating a consistently well-tested security platform across all products.

**Quality Assurance**:
With 428 comprehensive tests covering all auto-remediation functions and architectural analysis complete for the remaining 43 workflow functions, the SOAR platform is on track for enterprise-grade testing coverage ensuring reliability, security, and maintainability in production deployments.
